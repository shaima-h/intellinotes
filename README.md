## Motivation

We consume a vast amount of content daily, whether it's educational talks, motivational speeches, or insightful videos, often while commuting, exercising, or multitasking. It is essential to have notes to refer to in order to retain the knowledge, however, it's not practical to sit down and devote hours to hand-taking them.

With IntelliNotes, you can:

- Save time by skipping lengthy note-taking sessions.
- Retain knowledge with AI-generated summaries and action points.
- Edit and save the notes for future reference.
